      &nbsp;&nbsp;I love singing and listening to music more of the karaoke
      vibes,I enjoy dancing and watching others dance,&nbsp;&nbsp;I love reading
      novels although i find school and the whole education stuff boring but its
      essential. I would describe myself as having a jovial personality and also
      introverted at same time, I do enjoy outings and hangouts with friends but
      i would prefer my space to that in as much as im busy or occupied.
